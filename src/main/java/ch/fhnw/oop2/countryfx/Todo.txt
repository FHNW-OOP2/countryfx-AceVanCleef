Todo list of CountryFX:

        must have:
        //Todo: Bindings @CountryOverview, CountryEditor (and ListView) (still relevant?)

        Important (lvl01)
            RootPM:
                - add ObservableList<ContinentPM> selectedContinents //Covering multiple cases: Europa; Europa,Asien; Asien,Europa;
                - add value change listener to proxyCountry in order to recalculate the property values of selectedContinents
                  (The value change listener on allCountries is fine since it reacts on add(Country) remove(country) )
        Important (lvl02)



        1) ListView
            d) current selected item (to RootPM's selectedCountryId)
        2) Footer
            a) bindings / value change updates (see RootPM's allContinent)
        3) CountryOverview
            a) connection / binding to selectedCountryIdProperty
        4) CountryEditor
            a) connection / binding to selectedCountryIdProperty
        5) Header
            a) Save to File (incl. save() @RootPM and @Service)
        6) Basic Features
            a)  Save to File !important

        nice to have:
        1) UI schön machen


        fixed:
            -Bug spotted at pm.createNewCountry()
                         Reason: Since the new CountryPM-Obj. has null values, stream methods and their lambdas will throw a NullPointerException.
                         Easiest solution: Initialize the new CountryPM-Obj with "" instead of null for their string properties. That means:
                             public CountryPM(){
                                 setContinent("");
                             }
